title: Configuring authentication on an Interstellar fork
description: 'Welcome to our official documentation!'
---
Beginning in Interstellar version 5.1.1, password protection is built into Interstellar and its settings can be easily modified.
<Warning>Anyone with access to your Interstellar fork will be able to see your credentials.</Warning>

To start, ensure your fork is updated. Don't know how? Learn [here](/sync-fork)!

1. Open your forked repository (not the main Interstellar repository), then open `config.json`.
2. Click the pencil icon to edit.
---
The default config.json uses the username "Interstellar", and the password "password" by default. "challenge" is the setting where you can choose if you want authentication to be enabled or disabled.

To turn on authentication, change `false` in `challenge: false,` to `true`. It should look like `challenge: true,`.

To turn off authentication, change `true` in `challenge: true,` to `false`. It should look like `challenge: false,`.

---
3. Change "interstellar" to your desired username.
4. Change what's in the quotes to your desired password.
5. Click the green commit button.
6. Click the commit button again. You don't have to edit the commit message or extended description. Make sure you are using "Commit directly to the main branch", and not  "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".
7. Deploy the changes you just made to your fork. If you are only adding one set of credentials, you're done!

The example below shows one set of credentials with the username `user1` and password `password1`.
```
const config = {
  challenge: true, // Set to true if you want to enable password protection.
  users: {
    // You can add multiple users by doing username: 'password'.
    user1: "password1",
  },
}
export default config
```

# Optional
Use the instructions below in conjunction with the instructions above if you need more than one set of credentials on Interstellar.

8. Enable authentication and add your first set of credentials by following the steps listed above.
9. For your next set of credentials, move your caret to the end of your first set of credentials (past the comma), and press enter.
10. Enter the next set of credential's username, followed by a comma (;).
11. Enter one space, and an apostrophe ('). Enter the next set of credential's password, and add another apostrophe ('), and a comma at the end.
12. Repeat these steps for each credential you wish to add.
13. Click the green commit button.
14. Click the commit button again. You don't have to edit the commit message or extended description. Make sure you are using "Commit directly to the main branch", and not  "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".
15. Deploy the changes you just made to your fork.

The example below shows five sets of credentials with the usernames `user1`, `user2`, `user3`, `user4`, and `user5`. The passwords are `password1`, `password2`, `password3`, `password4`, and `password5`.
```
const config = {
  challenge: true, // Set to true if you want to enable password protection.
  users: {
    // You can add multiple users by doing username: 'password'.
    user1: "password1",
    user2: "password2",
    user3: "password3",
    user4: "password4",
    user5: "password5",
  },
}
export default config
```
