## Getting started
Before starting, you need to have a Github Account.
Make sure your [fork is updated](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).

Fork [the interstellar repo](https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar)

## Step 1
Visit [the vercel sign up page](https://vercel.com/signup) and signup, connect your github account.

## Step 2 
Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and click the forked repository.
Name your project and click deploy.

## Step 3 
Wait for your project to deploy.
Now you have a working vercel.app link.

If it asks you to verify with a phone number, either verify, or make a new account.
<Warning>If you get suspended from vercel, you get IP Banned. So, once you start to overuse resources delete your account before it gets banned.</Warning>
