This tutorial will likely be the easiest tutorial here with the fewest steps. Everything is already setup for you, and all you have to do is bring a domain. We recommend FreeDNS because it's free.

# Creating an A record on your domain registar
Make the name what you want your subdomain to be. The destination should be an A record pointed to `5.161.66.1`.

# Creating an A record on Cloudflare
This assumes you already have your domain setup with Cloudflare. Sign into your Cloudflare dashboard, click your domain, then click DNS. Add a new record, the name should be what you want the subdomain to be. The destination should be an A recorded pointed to `5.161.66.1`.

# Creating an A record with FreeDNS
See "Linking a deployment to FreeDNS" under "SaaS Platforms" to learn how to get an unblocked subdomain. The destination should be an A record set to `5.161.66.1`.
