### Q: I'm running my own Interstellar deployment. How come when I use the proxy, the 404 error pops up?

### Q: How do I get more Interstellar sites/links?
A: [Join our community on Discord](https://discord.gg/interstellar).

### Q: How do I login to GeForce NOW?

### Q: When I try to deploy Interstellar to Vercel, it shows "This Serverless Function has crashed.", why?
A: Interstellar is no longer compatible with Vercel, please use something else.

### Q: How do I clear my cache?
A: For Google Chrome users, [see this guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050). For Microsoft Edge users, [see this guide instead](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/learning-center/how-to-manage-and-clear-your-cache-and-cookies).
