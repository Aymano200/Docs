## Getting Started
Before starting, you need to have a GitHub account.

Make sure your fork is updated.

Make sure to fork https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar

## Step 1
Visit https://app.fl0.com/ and sign up with GitHub.

## Step 2 
Create a new project.

Give Fl0 access to your GitHub repositories.

Then click "Connect" on the forked repository.

Name the Application, then deploy it.

## Step 3
Wait for the application to deploy, and then you have a working fl0.io link.
