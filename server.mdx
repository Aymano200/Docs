### Installation


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone our repository locally">

```bash git
git clone https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar
```
```bash cd 
cd Interstellar
```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Install Depenedices">
  <CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm install
```
</CodeGroup>

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Start the site">
  If you want to start the site scaled across all available cores then run the following:
```bash pm2
pm2 start index.js -i max
```
If you want to start a select number of processes, replace the number with your choice.
```bash pm2
pm2 start index.js -i number
``` 
If you don't do this and your VPS shuts down, you'll have to start Interstellar manually using the steps above.
```bash pm2
pm2 startup 
```
```bash pm2
pm2 save 
```

## Configuring Caddy
This is how you add your domains to the server.
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Edit the Caddyfile">
This is a very simple way to add domains to your caddyfile.
```bash nano
nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```
Hold down ctrl+k until the file is empty.
  </Accordion>
      <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Pointing domains at your server">
Create an A record on your domain pointing to your VPS's IP address. Usually, the name on the A record will be your subdomain. Make sure to add this into the Caddyfile below.
</Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Adding domains">
Make sure your domains are pointed at your server.
Your Caddyfile should look something like this, of course replacing the domains in the first line with actual domains/subdomains.
```bash nano 

your-domain-here.com, 2nd-domain.com, 3rd.domain.com {
reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```
Save your Caddyfile by pressing Ctrl + X, then enter.
Then run
```bash systemctl
 systemctl restart caddy
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
## Firewall & Updating
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Setting up a firewall">
    ```bash apt-get
    apt-get install ufw
```
Run 
```bash ufw
 ufw allow 22
 ```
  If SSH is on another port, replace 22 with that port instead. This is mandatory, or you might lock yourself out of your VPS.
```bash ufw
ufw allow 443
```
If you have any other ports you need to allow, run 
```bash ufw
ufw allow port-number
```
```bash ufw 
ufw enable
```
```bash ufw
ufw reload
```
</Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Updating Interstellar">
Make sure you are in the Interstellar directory
```bash git
git pull 
```
```bash pm2 
pm2 restart all 
```
If you have multiple services running on pm2 and just want to restart Interstellar, find Interstellar's process ID and run
```bash pm2 
pm2 restart process-id 
```
