title: Updating your Interstellar fork
description: 'Welcome to our official documentation!'
---

If you have an existing Interstellar fork and want to update it, this guide is for you! If you do not yet have a fork of Interstellar, you can fork it [here](https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar).

Updates provide bug fixes, additional apps/games, and other improvements!

1. To start, [sign into the GitHub account](https://github.com/login) of which you created your fork on.
2. On the GitHub dashboard, click your profile at the top right corner of your screen. It should be a little circle icon with your profile picture, if you have one.
3. Click “Your repositories”
4. Find your Interstellar fork
5. Under the green “Code” button, click “Sync fork”
6. If your fork needs to be updated, it’ll say “This branch is out-of-date”. Click the green “Update branch” button.
7. GitHub will refresh and say “This branch is up to date with UseInterstellar/Interstellar:main.”

Your hosting provider may or may not auto-deploy after you update your fork. If it doesn’t, log into your provider and update it manually. If you don’t know how, you can find out by looking through your hosting provider’s documentation.
